Assignment to make a password generator

# Project Title: Challenge 1

## Project Objective:

The objective of this project was to make the code generate a random password with the assigned arrays whether it be lowercase, uppercase, special characters or numbers. I achieved this assigning variables to contain an array of those specific characters. Also by giving the user a choice of preference in what they want their password to include and how long they want their password to be.
